# {{module-name}}

A Finagle Thrift client for {{name}}.


### Creating a Client

    ({{ns}}/make-client "host:port")


You can call the methods defined by your Thrift service definition on this client.
The responses will all be wrapped in a Future (since this is an asynchronous operation).
The functions in `finagle-clojure.futures` can be used to transform the responses.
